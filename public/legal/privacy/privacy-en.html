    individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>

<h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
<p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. Sometimes it is also
    necessary to transmit personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external
    parties if this is necessary in the context of contract fulfillment, if we are legally obligated to do
    so (e.g., passing on data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6
    para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the transmission, or if another legal basis permits the data transmission. When
    using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract for
    order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.</p>

<h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>

    TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO
    APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED

    DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR
    INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL
    CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</p>
<p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY
    TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO
    APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS CONNECTED WITH SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL
    DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21
    PARA. 2 GDPR).</p>

<h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
<p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a
    supervisory authority, particularly in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of
    work, or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to
    other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>

<h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
<p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in
    fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format.
    If you request the direct transfer of data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent
    that it is technically feasible.</p>

<h3>Information, Correction and Deletion</h3>
<p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free
    information about your stored personal data, their origin and recipients, and the purpose of data
    processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any
    time regarding this and other questions about personal data.</p>

<h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
<p>You have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at
    any time regarding this. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify
        this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of
        your personal data.
    </li>
    <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request restriction of data
        processing instead of deletion.
    </li>
    <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of
        legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data
        instead of deletion.
    </li>
    <li>If you have lodged an objection according to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between
        your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have
        the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may – apart from its storage –
    only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for
    the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public
    interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>

    deletion occurs through your web browser.</p>
<p>Cookies can originate from us (first-party cookies) or from third-party companies (third-party cookies).
    Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services from third-party companies within

<p>Cookies that are necessary for carrying out the electronic communication process, for providing certain
    functions you have requested (e.g., for the shopping cart function), or for optimizing the website
    (e.g., cookies for measuring web audience) (necessary cookies) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1
    lit. f GDPR, unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in
    storing necessary cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If
    consent to the storage of cookies and comparable recognition technologies has been requested, processing
    is carried out exclusively on the basis of this consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1
    TTDSG); consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p>You can set your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual
    cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, and activate the automatic
    deletion of cookies when closing the browser. When cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this
    website may be limited.</p>
<p>Which cookies and services are used on this website can be found in this privacy policy.</p>
